# Musceppan
A simple project for converting music to score.

## Usage
Ever faced with the situation that an excellent melody comes to your mind, but you don't have a MIDI keyboard next to you, or under the restriction on electronic devices, such as in the school? Musceppan is just designed for you! With the simple tool, you can:
- Record your music creations with less noise
- Polish your music creations by checking the generated MIDI files
- Converting your music creations to scores with nice typesetting
- Generating scores in different formats through MIDI files

Thanks to the cross-platform compatibility of Python, Musceppan will be available on macOS, Windows, Android, iOS (and Linux with no guarantee of stable use).
