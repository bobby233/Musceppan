# Musceppan
A simple project for converting music to score.

## Usage
Ever faced with the situation that an excellent melody comes to your mind, but you don't have a MIDI keyboard next to you, or under the restriction on electronic devices, such as in the school? Musceppan is just designed for you! With the simple tool, you can:
- Record your music creations with less noise
- Polish your music creations by checking the generated MIDI files
- Convert your music creations to scores with nice typesetting
- Generat scores in different formats through MIDI files
- Play music via MIDI files (and score pictures [^1])

Thanks to the cross-platform compatibility of Python, Musceppan will be available on macOS, Windows, Android, iOS (and Linux with no guarantee of stable use).

[^1]: In long-term development.
